autoencoder is an unsupervised learning method, threshold to determine whether a data point is anomaly or not is an important hyper-parameter to tune, and you can use labeled data in testing step to find the best threshold in your dataset. for numerical dataset, you only need fully connected layers in the autoencoder structures(like multi-layer perceptron(MLP)), without convolutional neural network(CNN) or recurrent neural network(RNN) knowledge.
