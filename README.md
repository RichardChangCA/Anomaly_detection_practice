autoencoder is an unsupervised learning method, threshold to determine whether a data point is anomaly or not is an important hyper-parameter to tune, and you can use labeled data in testing step to find the best threshold in your dataset. for numerical dataset, you only need fully connected layers in the autoencoder structures(like multi-layer perceptron(MLP)), without convolutional neural network(CNN) or recurrent neural network(RNN) knowledge.

Autoencoder can do dimensionality reduction, which is better than PCA. Antoencoder can find the main pattern of the majority class, which can reveal outliers. Interestingly, during the process of dimensionality reduction, outliers are identified. We can say outlier detection is a by-product of dimension reduction. PCA is a linear-transoformation dimentionality reduction and autoencoder is a non-linear-transfomation dimentionality reduction. In addition, there are several hyper-links inside of this article(why anomaly detection, feature enginnering in anomaly detection, etc.). PyOD is a Pyhton package for anomly detection. the outlier is a data point that generated new input is distant from other data points. You can also use ensemble learning to combine many outlier detection models together to predict outliers, to avoid overfitting.

3. Medium, Fraud Detection Under Extreme Class Imbalance: https://towardsdatascience.com/fraud-detection-under-extreme-class-imbalance-c241854e60c ,for time-series data, anomalies are data points which show different patterns(the problem is how to detect these changed patterns)

- Statistical techniques: average, quantiles, probability distribution, association rules

- Supervised ML algorithms: logistic regression, neural net, time-series analysis

- Unsupervised ML algorithms: Cluster analysis, Bayesian network, Peer group analysis, break point analysis, Benfordâ€™s law (law of anomalous numbers)

5. Medium, Feature Engineering for Credit Card Fraud Detection https://towardsdatascience.com/how-to-create-good-features-in-fraud-detection-de6562f249ef you can simply find some obvious anomalies and write hard rules to detect them without ML models, like the example of transaction between NY and Boston case in this article. Maybe some data points with some certrain features are more likely to be anomalies. You can also create some innovative features based on original dataset features to detect anomalies efficiently. The difficulty is how to create useful features, and there are several papers in this article which may give some insights.
